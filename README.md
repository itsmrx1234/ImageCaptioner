# 🖼️ Multimodal Image Captioning Model

This project presents a **Multimodal Image Captioning Model** that generates descriptive captions for uploaded images by combining computer vision and natural language processing techniques. It leverages the power of the **Gemma language model**, fine-tuned with **QLoRA**, integrated into a unified pipeline for image-to-text generation.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Image-to-Text Pipeline**: Upload an image and receive a human-like caption.
- 🧠 **Gemma Language Model**: Fine-tuned using QLoRA for efficiency and enhanced generation.
- 🔗 **Multimodal Integration**: Combines vision and language tasks in a single AI system.
- ⚡ **Optimized for Performance**: Fast inference with minimal resource consumption.
